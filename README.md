# üöó Vehicle MLops Project ‚Äî End-to-End Production-Grade Machine Learning Deployment

## Overview

This project is a **cutting-edge, fully automated MLops pipeline for a vehicle data ML application**‚Äîfrom experiment tracking to cloud deployment with real-time prediction!
Built to be **robust, scalable, and cloud-native**, this project shows my ability to take a machine learning project from *local development* all the way to *production deployment* using modern DevOps and ML engineering best practices.

---

## üåü Key Features & Technologies

* **Project Automation:**

  * Codebase bootstrapped via a custom template generator (`template.py`)
  * Modular structure: `setup.py` and `pyproject.toml` for local package management, ensuring reusable, production-grade code

* **Environment & Dependency Management:**

  * Isolated Python (3.10) `venv`/`conda` environments
  * Locked dependencies with `requirements.txt`, validated via `pip list` for reproducibility

* **Cloud-Native Data Storage:**

  * Automated ingestion and push to **MongoDB Atlas** (NoSQL cloud database)
  * Secure, connection-string based access with robust `.env`/environment variable handling

* **Robust Logging & Error Handling:**

  * Custom `logger` and `exception` modules for transparent monitoring and debugging
  * End-to-end traceability for all pipeline steps

* **End-to-End Modular Pipeline:**

  * **Data Ingestion:** Pulls fresh data from MongoDB and transforms it into analysis-ready DataFrames
  * **Data Validation & Transformation:**

    * YAML-driven data schema validation
    * Automated checks, missing value handling, and feature engineering
  * **Model Trainer:**

    * Modular, pluggable ML training with scikit-learn
    * Artifact and config management for experiment tracking
  * **Model Evaluation & Drift Detection:**

    * Model evaluation with threshold-based drift detection
    * Evaluation score delta (`MODEL_EVALUATION_CHANGED_THRESHOLD_SCORE`) and versioning

* **Cloud Model Registry & Artifact Storage:**

  * AWS S3 integration for automatic model pushing, pulling, and registry
  * Secure access via environment variables and IAM user roles

* **Production-Ready Prediction Service:**

  * FastAPI REST API for real-time prediction
  * Clean separation of app (`app.py`), templates, and static assets

* **MLops at Scale ‚Äî CI/CD, Docker, AWS, and Self-Hosted Runner:**

  * **Dockerized** app: reproducible builds, ‚Äúworks on my machine‚Äù solved
  * **.dockerignore** for lean images, excludes local environments/artifacts
  * **AWS ECR & EC2:**

    * Automated image builds/push to ECR
    * Production deployment to EC2 (Ubuntu 24.04, secure keypair)
  * **GitHub Actions CI/CD:**

    * Multi-stage workflow triggers on every push
    * Self-hosted EC2 runner for cost-effective, scalable pipeline execution
  * **GitHub Secrets** for secure, cloud-native credentials management

## üöÄ Step-by-Step Implementation Highlights

1. **Template-Driven Project Scaffold:**

   * One-command project creation with `template.py`
   * Modern Python packaging: `setup.py` and `pyproject.toml`
2. **Virtual Environment Setup:**

   * Reproducible local dev with `venv` or `conda` (Python 3.10)
   * Dependency management via `requirements.txt`
3. **Cloud Database Integration:**

   * Seamless MongoDB Atlas setup and IP whitelisting
   * Notebook-driven data upload and inspection
4. **Robust Engineering Practices:**

   * Custom logging, error handling, and modular configs
   * EDA and feature engineering in dedicated notebooks
5. **Configurable Pipeline Components:**

   * Constants and environment variables for all critical configs
   * Modular ingestion, validation, transformation, and training pipeline
6. **Cloud Model Management:**

   * AWS S3 bucket for model artifacts
   * S3-powered model pusher and registry for production robustness
7. **Prediction API & App:**

   * FastAPI backend with clear static/template separation
   * Dockerized for rapid deployment anywhere
8. **CI/CD & Cloud Deployment:**

   * Docker, .dockerignore, ECR, EC2, and self-hosted GitHub Actions runner
   * Automated port, security, and networking setup

## üèÜ What Makes This Project Stand Out

* **True MLops End-to-End:**
  Not just a notebook! Full reproducibility, automation, and cloud deployment‚Äîno manual handoffs.
* **Production-Grade Practices:**
  Handles environment secrets, versioned models, cloud artifact registry, error logging, and data drift.
* **CI/CD from Scratch:**
  End-to-end automation: build, test, deploy with GitHub Actions + AWS cloud infra.
* **Battle-Tested Cloud Stack:**
  Works seamlessly with MongoDB Atlas, AWS S3/ECR/EC2, and FastAPI.
* **Security by Design:**
  All sensitive keys managed via env vars/GitHub secrets, not in code.
* **Scalability:**
  Dockerized, cloud-native‚Äîready for enterprise scaling and multi-developer teams.

## üõ†Ô∏è Core Tools & Technologies

* **Python 3.10**, FastAPI, scikit-learn, pandas, PyYAML
* **MongoDB Atlas (cloud DB)**, AWS S3/ECR/EC2, Docker, GitHub Actions
* **Modular Python packaging:** `setup.py`, `pyproject.toml`
* **Automated pipelines**: Custom exception/logging, YAML configs, artifacts registry
* **Cloud/DevOps:**

  * Dockerfile, .dockerignore, .gitignore
  * AWS CLI, IAM roles, S3 buckets, ECR images
  * GitHub self-hosted runner, CI/CD workflows

## ‚ö° Challenges Tackled

* Environment management in hybrid local/cloud/CI/CD contexts
* Robust, reusable data pipeline architecture (modular, testable)
* Secure, automated model and artifact storage in AWS S3
* Zero-downtime deployment with Docker and CI/CD
* Handling data schema changes and model drift in production

## üö¶ How to Run Locally

1. Clone this repo, set up a virtual environment, and install requirements.
2. Configure `.env` for MongoDB and AWS keys (never in code!).
3. Launch the pipeline with `demo.py` for end-to-end training/eval, or run `app.py` to start FastAPI server for predictions.
4. Use the provided notebooks for EDA and feature engineering.
